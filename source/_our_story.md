## Our Story

---

Hi, coffee lover. My name is Annie and my husband is Geoff. We're so glad you're here. We'd love to tell you more about how Strayhouse began.

When we moved to Western Oklahoma a few years ago, we were sad to find very few places that offered craft coffees. We decided to pursue Geoff's dream of opening a coffee shop. We liked the aspect of being mobile and discussed a coffee food truck out of an old Airstream trailer.

In May of 2015 we had a one month old baby and went on the hunt for this vintage trailer. The Airstream dream became a second (and maybe even more demanding baby) than our human was. We put in the hours, the sweat, the fear, the hope and on December 1st, 2015 we parked at our first event.

We've been caffeinating Clinton and the surrounding area ever since. We've even bought an old building downtown to help handle the demand.

> Please let us know you and serve you excellent coffee. Happy trails.
