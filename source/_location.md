## Location

---

Strayhouse Kitchen + Coffee is located within a century old lumber yard in historic Downtown Clinton, OK. 

The "Main Dining Building" was constructed out of the hardward store and office building of Washita Lumber Company, completed in 1907. In 1910, LongBell Lumber Company of KCMO purchased Washita Lumber Company and renovated the structure in 1926 to add a blue paver stone facade and large glass storefront windows. When LongBell Lumber declared bankruptcy in 1956, TH Rogers of Oklahoma, purchased the property and operated out of the location until 2012. The property sat vacant until 2016, when Strayhouse Kitchen + Coffee repurposed the space to function as a restaurant & espresso bar. 

Using as much of the original materials found on the property and structure, Strayhouse designed the building to resemble a modern take on the renderings they found of the building's original remodel, circa 1920's, completed by LongBell Lumber Company of Kansas City, MO. Strayhouse has become a popular stop for those who appreciate early Oklahoma architecture.
